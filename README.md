## In this folder, I compiled a number of my example projects that involve various regression, classification, and deep learning algorithms.


## <font color='blue'> Project T and T2: 
A time series project that aims to analyze the correlation between time and various energy related stocks. Data are imported from Yahoo Finance API or NYSE. LSTM models with different optimizers and parameters are able to make predictions with reasonably good scores. Other cutting edge models such as GRU are also tested. One of the notebook used Keras, and another used Tensorflow.
