## In this folder, I compiled a number of my example projects that involve various regression, classification, and deep learning algorithms.


##  Project T and T2: 
A time series project that aims to analyze the correlation between time and various energy related stocks. Data are imported from Yahoo Finance API or NYSE. LSTM models with different optimizers and parameters are able to make predictions with reasonably good scores. Other cutting edge models such as GRU are also tested. One of the notebook used Keras, and another used Tensorflow.
##   Photovoltaic:
A project for solar and solar power prediction. This analysis provides insights on renewable energy usage and maintenance, which are becoming more and more relevant in the age of electrical cars and global warming awareness.
##   Riak Analysis:
This project has the following purposes: 1. Evaluating the risk involved with an event (including but not limited to approving a loan). 2. Performing customer segmentation based on risks and other factors. 3. Exploring metrics and methods towards accurate risk management.
