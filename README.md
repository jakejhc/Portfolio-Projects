## In this folder, I compiled a number of example projects that I have worked on, which involves various regression, classification, and deep learning algorithms.


## <font color='blue'> Project T and T2: 
A time series project that aims to analyze the correlation between time and various energy related ETFs or stocks. Data are imported from Yahoo Finance API or NYSE. LSTM models with different optimizer and parameters are able to make prediction with reasonably good scores. Other cutting edge models such as GRU are also tested. One of the notebook used Keras, and another used Tensorflow.
